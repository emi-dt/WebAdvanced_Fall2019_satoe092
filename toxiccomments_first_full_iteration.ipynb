NO alternate NOCs: EUA, FRG and GER have always had the same German National Olympic Committee (NOC) recognized in 1895, same NOC President (Willi Daume, 1960–1993), same Olympic Committee located in Frankfurt - only the codes have changed. Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). \"\"West Germany\"\" did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG. The \"\"enlarged\"\" Federal Republic of Germany (known simply as \"\"Germany\"\") is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany - the very same country, with the same National Olympic Committee since 1895.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  Do as aspectual auxiliary.  This is the only function of DO as an auxiliary verb and is its primary function within the language.  The non-durational aspects in English (everything not progressive/continuous aspects) are marked by the aspectual auxiliary DO followed by its subordinate in bare form.  English has two aspectual auxiliaries, DO & BE.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Do is not a modal auxiliary.  It does not express emphasis / emphatic mood.  Rather, DO when used as an aspectual auxiliary may be emphasized just like any other word in a sentence.  There is no emphatic modal auxiliary in English.  English simply uses vocal stress (or in type, boldface or ALL CAPS) to emphasize the desired element.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Perfection / perfecting auxiliary is valid.  Perfect is not an aspect but rather a verb in any aspect may be perfected.  Perfection is a grammatical category used to express completeness of a verb.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. I have changed the repeated phrasing \"\"Most auxiliaries\"\" / \"\"Most modals\"\" to ...some... because this sort of generalisation is simply untrue and unfounded.  If anything, of the modal auxiliaries, those that subordinate to infinitive form are at best in approximately 50% distribution to those that do not.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  In the discussion of the various forms following make, I have once again removed the claim for passive voice.  That usage is not in passive voice at all as BE is not acting as a vocal auxiliary but rather BE+MADE is acting as a single unit forming a modal auxiliary.  Whereas MAKE as a modal auxiliary conveys internal force and subordinates to bare form, BE+MADE expresses external force and subordinates to infinitive form.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  Within the section on defective verbs I have eliminated some poor and misleading examples while rewording others.  That section comes close to conflating infintives with infinitive form and as worded was misleading.\n",

Stats tell you what happened (but not how). In sports, that is very important, for teams and individuals. I don't think you're looking at enough season recaps for other QBs to really compare what the alternative would be. Based on what you're saying, you would deem those pages as being long sprawling lists of stats as well. I gave the articles some style by adding some structure to it. This way if you could go back and do it for past seasons, everything would be consistent. Right now, the old seasons are largely unsourced and the writing is too bulky at times.

      "\n",
      "The current title used has a natural disambiguation, which is always preferable in an article name and obeys WP:TITLE and WP:NATURAL. I don't wish to make a statement without any evidence to support it, but where I come from, everyone knows what the term 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' means and what it represents so it's not unpopular. The acronym 'ISIL' is also accurate enough to represent the group. That being said, I have started to notice that both these terms are being displaced by 'ISIS', 'Islamic State' and 'IS' in publications that I read, and news that I tune in to. Many reliable sources are also starting to refer to it as 'Islamic State' with many many different variants. The other fact that also should be considered here is the actual wording in the name. 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' makes the group sound as if it is geographically locked in these two regions, with no territory or ambition to spread outside of its primary spheres of influence. Similar to the Taliban-controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. And, dare I say, it also makes them sound more legitimate as a group then just the ambiguous 'Islamic State' designation, due to the emphasis placed upon the areas of 'Iraq and the Levant'. Makes it sound more formal. But it is now not the case. As multiple editors have stated, it is not merely a parochial militant group with territory in the regions of Iraq, Syria and now even parts of Lebanon but a transnational entity bent on expansion. I cannot see how relegating it to two geographic positions is the mature thing to do in an Encyclopedia, whatever the intention. It is becuase of this that I do not believe the current name and its disambiguation is viable anymore, purely for this reason. Some editors had stated the potential and very real problem of justifying 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' territory outside of Iraq and the Levant. It's not a recognized entity as far as I know. You cannot liken it to the Russian Federation having territory outside of Russia in Europe e.g Kaliningrad or the United States having territory outside of North America e.g Hawaii. What I am getting at is that this implies a level of legitimate ownership, and this group doesn't have it. Not in Libya or Yemen or Iraq or Syria or anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue I have with \"\"Islamic State (IS)\"\" is the disambiguation which, whilst being a widely used acronym for the group, can not be measured accurately to satisfy WP:COMMONAME through Google searches alone. Even though many sources use 'IS' which has been stated, on its own as a disambiguation, it is simply too generic. A similar issue arises with the term \"\"Islamic State\"\". However, were you to isolate the period for a search, the results would become more accurate, and this has already been stated. If a more appropriate disambiguation were to be found that could in concise terms explain what the article is about, I would support it. I suggest something along the lines of Islamic State (organisation) or Islamic State (ISIS) or Islamic State (group) or Islamic State (militant group). I am under the impression that WP:OFFICIAL and WP:COMMONAME are the important policies here, as editor  stated, and in my opinion the current title doesn't satisfy either, whilst a proposed title has the potential to satisfy both. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason why I choose to support this current proposal, is that progress towards a better article name will emerge allot quicker were it 'Islamic State (IS)' vs. a proposed alternative rather than the current title vs. a proposed alternative.   \n",

Weaver's book is not without its own bias (\"\"Branham was a victim of his own illusions\"\", 2000,p173) and errors (\"\"He believed that the final manifestation of his gift would transform physical bodies into the glorified ones necessary for the rapture\"\", 2000, p173).  Some of Weaver's conclusions can be easily disproved by reference to the over 1,000 audio sermons and transcripts online.

      "The film makes several suggestions that V is blind and benefits from enhanced senses like Marvel's Daredevil. When he emerges from the fire, Delia says he looked at her, but not with eyes, as he had no eyes. Obviously he seems to have no eyes behind the mask, but the citizens wearing the mask throughout the film also have no visible eyes. This could be a screen behind the mask for style purposes, although shots of V putting on the mask show that it has no screen behind the eyes and mouth. V does seem to be wearing a skimask/hood behind his mask, though. In the scene where V is disguised as a police officer and kidnaps Evey, he is wearing a burn prostethic behind the ski-mask and if you look closely, he seems to have large blacked eyes, similar to Hellraiser Cenobites. In the scenes where V emerges from the burning ruins of Larkhill, the closeup of his face also reveals his eyes to be \"\"black\"\". Also while in disguise later as Brookewood(or whatever), he is wearing a pair of shades. This could be for one of two reasons: To disguise his black/missing eyes, or to make rectal identification impossible. \n",

      "Lloyd was born in Burchard, Nebraska, to James Darsie Lloyd (1865–1947) and Elizabeth Fraser (1869–1941); Harold's paternal great-grandparents were all from Wales. Young Harold was named for his paternal grandfather. Harold had an older brother, Gaylord (1888-1943), five years his senior. Like his younger brother, Gaylord acted in motion pictures, but his career was nowhere near as renowned as Harold's. Among other roles, he acted in 1921's \"\"Disraeli\"\" starring the famous George Arliss.  With Harold's help, there were even efforts to turn him into a comedy star.  He eventually went on to become a film executive.  When Harold was a child, his parents divorced and Lloyd chose to stay with his father.  Despite this, he and his brother always remained close to their mother.  Harold's father was always dreaming up grand get-rich-quick schemes that ended in disasters. They eventually ended up in Omaha where Lloyd had his first acting experience in a local stock company. He attended East High School and San Diego High School and received his stage training at the School of Dramatic Art (San Diego). In 1912, his father J. Darsie \"\"Foxy\"\" Lloyd was awarded the then-massive sum of $6,000 in a personal injury judgment (although this was split evenly between Lloyd and his lawyer) after being run over by an Omaha beer truck. Reportedly, on the toss of a coin (\"\"Heads is New York or Nashville or where I decide!, tails is San Diego\"\"), he and Lloyd moved west.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd had acted in various Vaudeville acts in theaters since boyhood, and started acting in one-reel film comedies shortly after moving to California. He soon began working with Thomas Edison's motion picture company, and eventually formed a partnership with fellow struggling actor and director Hal Roach, who had formed his own studio in 1913. The hard-working Lloyd became the most successful of Roach's comic actors between 1915 and 1919.\n",

The dispute arose because I had put in a link to a Central Michigan University timeline on lighthouses in Michigan in an article on Marquette, Michigan  the link was perfectly appropriate, and was not a commercial site or spam.  I received a note from Barek saying he had deleted the link on the Discussion page.  I told him it was a perfectly fine link and that his action was ill-advised.  The next thing I knew, Hu12 intervened.  The two of them started Wikistalking me together, removing not just the link, but removing the link from every page where I had put it.  Additionally, they started doing blind \"\"Undos\"\" and obliterating large portions of articles that I had contributed.  There was no reason for any of this.  When I protested their course of action, they suspended my editing privileges.  This was done precipitously.  BK Conrad has investigated this matter, and deems the blind edits to be 'unfortunate.'\n",

      "I have had to deal with this person continually since before Christmas. Someone posted questionable content to her talk page, whereupon she intitiated an unfounded sock case against me at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Wildhartlivie/Archive. Then she filed a report here about me. Next she popped up at Black Dahlia, an article upon which she had never previously edited, to revert something I removed and has maintained a overly long, ridiculously drawn out discussion with editors there. At one point, Crohnie admonished her for treating her like \"\"an idiot or something\"\". Next she popped up at Charles Manson, also an article upon which she had not previously edited, to throw herself into an issue I was involved in and making unsupported statements, which she has proceeded to edit war over. She then joined WP:CRIME, a project in which I'm active. It is quote obvious she is stalking my edits. Finally tonight, another editor came to Talk:Black Dahlia to enter a content vote, and SkagitRiverQueen made an outright accusation against me of canvassing votes, where she clearly and unequivocably said \"\"It's obvious that some editors have been canvassed specifically to sway the vote (and am I making an accusation here? yes, indeed, I am).\"\" I asked her to withdraw her comment and her response was \"\"And, frankly, regardless of whether or not I can prove it, I don't believe that you *haven't* canvassed for input here.\"\" She was clearly challenged on this by LaVidaLoca here and Pinkadelica here. I want this editor to stop following me around, picking tenditious arguments and making specious and unfounded accusations against me. Wildhartlivie (talk) \n",
      "\n",
      "I endorse these comments by Wildhartlivie. I object to the specious claim that my opinion was canvassed in anyway and believe SkagitRiverQueen's intent is tenditious and assaultive in nature. For the record, she has reverted the Manson article 3 times, even after she was asked not to edit war over it. It appears to me that she is wikihounding Wildhartlivie and would take exception to anything she says or does. This is an untenable situation that needs to stop. LaVidaLoca (talk)  \n",
      "As the editor who instigated the preliminary consensus vote (and as such a possible cohort in the WP:CANVASS), I must agree that this claim against Wildhartlivie is specious and unwarranted. I have attempted to instruct SkagitRiverQueen on the proper way to engage in disputes (mainly not attacking other editors based on perceived editing style). This has not worked as of yet. I do see a pattern of \"\"wikihounding\"\" here on SkagitRiverQueen's part, as do many other editors, and this has persisted for some time. This feud must end... Doc9871 (talk)  \n",
      "IMO, this is purely retaliation by Wildhartlivie for the sock-puppet investigation (exactly why it's the first thing she mentioned in the complaint even though the issue has been over and done for nearly a couple of weeks, now). Not only is she reverting practically everything I have edited recently, she is now reverting entire sections of large articles I have edited[18]. On top of that, she continues to call me by an inflammatory name (\"\"Skag\"\" - I have noted on my User Page it is *not* an acceptible contraction of my user name; she even mentioned earlier today that she has read that admonition on my user page[19] that is a known slang term for women who have less than savory reputations[20]). Now, in addition to everything else, she has placed an \"\"edit war\"\" warning on my talk page *after* she filed this report.[21] I am not in an edit war - and am actually trying to reason with the editor of that article who has been reverting my recent edits.[22] Wildhartlivie has publically called my mental and emotional health into question here in Wikipedia on more than one occasion. Additionally, she has a questionable history that includes abuse of her rollback privileges (see User talk:Wildhartlivie for the warning she recently received and User talk:GTBacchus for her responses to the warning), continued incivility to anyone who edits articles she watches, and canvassing her Wikipedia friends to back her up whenever her edits or actions are called into question (above content from LaVidaLoca is proof of this). And yes, I do believe she canvassed editors by email regarding the issue we have been discussing at Talk:Black Dahlia. Concerning this complaint, you will likely also hear from User:Doc9871, User:Pinkadelica, User:Crohnie, User:Rossrs, User:Vidor, and User:Equazcion - all editors she has canvassed in the past when she feels she needs support in one of her efforts to prove me wrong. Evidence of this can be found at [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. In those instances, she out-and-out lied that I mentioned four of those editors in any fashion - yet, her\n",

Infact, in speaking about the difficulty that the untrained or sometimes even the trained Tamil(and I certainly and strongly feel that he is talking about people who have received their training in Tamil Nadu.  I dont think he would have based his views or book on somebody who learnt or spoke Tamil in say, Germany or France in the mid 19th century) faces, Caldwell is speaking about nothing but diglossia, maybe without putting it down in as many words.\n",

      "\n",
      "What I am trying to say is, while scientific interest and research into diglossia might be a development of the last few decades, 'diglossia'(in tamil) existed nonetheless, even before that.

Talking of newsreaders and the lingo on street, I just remembered an interesting thing about the Kannada spoken by the people of South Kanara.  It is almost exactly like the one employed in the news or in formal documents, in that, they speak much the same way they and the rest of Karnataka would write.

Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.

      " Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers.\n",
      " Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened\n",
      " Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation.\n",
      " Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work.\n",
      " Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up.\n",
      " Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation.\n",
      " Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare.\n",
      " It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner.\n",
      " Natural finance's definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth. The affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.\n",

      "TABThe first “Steroid” was a product developed in the 1930’s to give much needed testostarone to people whose bodies did not produce enough on their own. It just so happens that testosterone helps build muscle at an alarming rate. Once Steroids were proven effective on animals, Germany used these steroids on soldiers in WWII. The Germans saw that their POW’s (Prisoners of War) were suffering from malnutrition, so they made the decision to treat them with steroids. The steroids helped prevent muscle loss, thus making them live longer. It wasn’t until the mid 1950’s where steroids were first used in professional sports. Many Russian and European weightlifters used these steroids to increase their game and dominate the sport of power lifting.\n",
      "TABThere are many types of Steroids, but the most common of them all is anabolic-androgenic.  Most athletes take this steroid for the good effects the anabolic part brings. Anabolic means increasing body tissue (mostly muscle). So when an athlete takes the steroid their muscles increase dramatically giving them an impressive amount of strength. The only bad effect this part brings is that it can increase your muscles so dramatically; it can cause the user to become more prone to injury. The androgenic portion of the steroid is the bad part. This part is highly related to the male hormone: testosterone. This increases facial hair, baldness, nervousness, bad breath, and much more. The doctors sometimes prescribe their patients steroids because of the androgenic part. Androgenic helps synthesize testosterone, giving much needed help to patients whose bodies do not produce enough on their own. Doctors however prescribe only about 4-10 mg a day, whereas an athlete may take up to 100mg a day. Steroids are still not safe even if you use it in small doses, unless your body is lacking testosterone. Athletes need to consider the dangers of Steroids and not just the increased muscle tissue.\n",
      "TABAs well as the many types of Steroids, they can also be taken a couple different ways. The most common way to take Steroids is through injection; this is when the user takes a liquid steroid out of a bottle and puts in a needle. The user then injects the needle directly in the skin, like a shot in the doctor’s office. This can be especially dangerous because many abusers do not use sterile needles. HIV and AIDS can be transmitted from a person that has the disease to a person who does not have it. The other way you take steroids is in a pill form through the mouth. This is used less then injection throughout the athletic world because they do not work as well. Injection works faster and is much more efficient then pills. Pills are chea\n",

However as the article progressed, I continued to see an increasing amount of methods (both right and wrong) that I recognized from first hand experience. Throughout high school I was continuously asked to tutor children (typically students between first and fourth grade) and so one of the most commonly used methods was the additive method. The children I tutored, especially the younger ones, found it difficult to distinguish when to use the multiplicative method versus the additive method. Originally I found this frustrating but reading this article, and in particular the section on the ‘Mr. Short and Mr. Tall’ experiment, made it clear as to why the kids didn’t understand. \n",

The freedom to buy, own, and resell property?  What is economic freedom?  What are economic rights?  If you look at economic freedom as a matter of having the liberty to do make and spend money without state interference, American liberalism is pretty far from it, with American conservative orbiting little closer.  American government is rife with policies designed to encourage or punish specific economic behavior with taxation.  We don't want people to smoke, so we tax the hell out of cigarettes.  Is that economic liberty?  We want people to own property rather than rent, so we let homeowners write off interest, but not renters.  Is it economic freedom that people who can't afford a home or who have poor credit are punished by not being able to write-off part of their domicile expense?  No, neither philosophy even remotely resembles economic freedom by any conventional definition.  Both abuse the power of government to try to manage the economy, influence the economic behavior of citizens, and encourage and discourage specific personal decisions based on a code of morality unique to each philosophy.\n",

      "Comment - 'Station' as a word essentially means 'a fixed point'.  I'm not sure of the exact definition in the past, but it pre-dates railways by several centuries.  'Battle stations' as a term dates back some considerable way, and naval vessels in their correct patrol areas were said to be 'on station' in Nelson's time.  I believe it is derived from a Latin word meaning 'still' (i.e. 'stationary').  'Railway station' as a term goes back at least as far as 1825, while 'train station' was not recorded for over a century after that, nor were 'petrol station', 'power station' or 'bus station'.  One important consideration is how widespread a term is.  Is it a 'railway station' in Australia, India, South Africa or any other country where the British built the railways?  Finally, the term 'train' may be incorrect when referring to modern passenger railway vehicles.  Under some definitions, trains are exclusively loco-hauled or push-pull.  Most modern passenger vehicles are multiple units, and thus not 'trains' under these definitions, because there is no locomotive.128.240.229.3\n",

Sure, what's great for me isn't necessarilly great for you; but when something is great for the many, the qualification becomes objective.  Hellmuth is regularly the chosen televised table, and was invited to this year's tournament of champions event (despite not qualifying) solely for his television appeal.  He currently has logged more minutes on ESPN than any other player.  I'm sorry if you don't know this subject well enough to understand it, but Hellmuth is univerally known and agreed to produce great television.  If I watched Michael Jordan play basketball and thought he was bad, it would not change the fact that he could be objectively described as a \"\"great\"\" basketball player.

This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page because even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were consumed and finally eclipsed by their local rivals in Kannada country as well as by the Kakatiyas.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas, when it was the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them?

      "Hello Botteville. Yes, I suppose it is more or less a misunderstanding. The things are quite complicated and there is another possibility for the origin of the latinized version Carolus and I do not think it directly comes from *Kar(i)laz, because Carolus was borrowed from Germanic, when Common Germanic had already disappeared for a long time, that is quite hypothetic, and there is another possible etymology. See for example this very well documented site . I suppose Carolus was borrowed from Old High German or Old Franconian. That is why I do not accept the very shortened statement *Kar(i)laz > Carolus. I agree totally about Carolus > Charles, with some typical French phonetic shifts. I know that the meaning of churl is different, but it is the same etymological root, ultimatly from *kar(i)laz, sure, but through an intermediate West Germanic form *keril-. About disambig and so on, you can arrange it the way you want to. You can improve it the way you want to. I am not able to make that. Regards\n",

      "In general, the reusable parts of fuel are long-lived and the parts that complicate reuse of spent fuel are short-lived.  In general, fuel becomes easier to reprocess over time, largely because less shielding is needed to protect against radiation from the decay of short-lived fission products.  One exception is the decay of Pu-241 (with a half-life of 14 years) to Am-241 (half-life 432 years).  Though the decay rate is much lower, the radiation hazard is higher because the decay includes a low-energy gamma ray.  Recycled fuel with higher Am-241 is therefore somewhat harder to handle safely.  Also, the Am-241 is not fissile and is therefore prone to absorb neutrons (in a standard light-water reactor) and produce higher transuranics rather than fission and produce energy and fission products, so the spent fuel is also harder to handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast reactors in principle can help reduce these problems, since most transuranics undergo fission in a fast neutron spectrum.  But fast reactors do not have a strong track record of reliability and carry a significant cost premium.

      "Anti-Serb sentiment is an umbrella term or generalization, obviously it will be poorly sourced just as List of Massacres in the Kosovo war is a WP creation. We find a subject then we link sources/stories to it but many articles do not represent a real world phenomenon. The fact is that Serbophobia as a concept is not a \"\"myth\"\" but it is confined to the nation's sympathizers and is rejected by the nation's detractors. Obviously Serbophobia is more degrading and more emphatic than \"\"anti-Serb sentiment\"\" in that implies an outright hatred. Naturally no Serb can truly accept no nation recognizing their declared states in Croatia (Krajina) and Eatern Bosnia during the Yugoslav Wars, seeing a West-brokered peace deal in 1994 putting at end to Bosniak-Croat hostilities then all uniting for a joint attack to end the Serb rebel states alongside world powers and claiming that the unlawful grounds for existence of those states was that they were not AVNOJ entities - and then a few years later support the UCK in Kosovo, pushing from the first moment to have FRY forces expelled, succeeding after airstrikes then nine years later recognize Kosovo - no AVNOJ argument there. But it doesn't end there, Kosovo achieved widespread positive feedback from US recognition to \"\"welcoming of independence\"\" from organizations such as the Basque authority in Spain - all entitled to their own opinions, but Serbs who claim Serbophobia are neither stupid nor blind to world events. You don't get the same positive and warm reception let alone recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia nor many other would-be states to exist or to have existed before being retaken by an aggressor (in the eyes of locals). These feats give Serbs to feel they are victims of international protectionism and that alone is enough to prove the sentiment. You're not going to convince them with fairy stories about how their heavy-handed 1990s oppression or disproportionate number of atrocities that time influenced on what side nations would eventually fall. That said, Savich and Trifkovic are fine sources, people just don't like them because their ethnicity so-called \"\"overrules\"\" their wisdom.   \"\n",

Yamhill is the code name of a project for ever Intel's own 64bit x86 processor, EM64T is a technology to extract the most potential capability of IA-32, making it to address up to 64TiB physical address. IA32e is not a mode of Yamhill processor, but the superset or extension of IA-32e, in other words, when ia32e enabled 32bits and 64bits codes could work seamlessly, because ia32e scale up the original IA-32 by extending the width of registers and execution units, extended segment descriptors and paging mechanism would also introduced with it. IA32e does not make a processor turn into a real 64 bit processor, but just make a 32 bit processor has the capability to do the 64 bit computing from the ground. The benefits of this is that we don't have a second 64bit-lised IA-32, what we need is an architecture completely designed for 64 bit computing from scratch, for example Itanium or something else.

So segmentation had been accompanied with x86 processor since its beginning. Without protection mechanism introduced, segmenataion is the only way to address all possible and potential physical space. Because Segmentation is found in the real mode, so addresses in Segmentation tends to be real, with solid link the physcial address rather than virtual address when in protected mode when paging is enabled. So if it is a real x86 processor, its maximum physical addressing space should be limited by its segmentation mechanism rather than paging.\"\n",

Indeed, when I became aware of the situation in the RFC, I should have brought it here myself.

The good news is you're doing a great job writing articles and adding references, etc.  I even nominated one of your contributions to be featured in the Did You Know section of the front page.  The bad news is that you're not getting the free image concept here.  You've been blocked here for uploading non-free images, and now I see you are doing the same thing at Wikimedia Commons.  Excepting the photos that are clearly old where the copyright has expired, I am going to delete a number of your uploads there as copyright violations.  The PD-ineligible tags you used there are reserved for cases where no copyright can be claimed - images of lines and shapes and words, etc.  Not photographs.  I am going to recommend that you refrain from uploading images here or there (except, as I said, photographs that are from before 1923 and clearly in the public domain).

Turley said, \"\"There are very candid statements on the part of participants to a Church official under the agreement of confidentiality.\"\"\n",

According to Turley, LDS leaders share the authors' desire to bring all available evidence out in the open. First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. \"\"Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,\"\" Turley said, adding that the authors will \"\"present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.\"\"\n",

After reading it, I have looked into the subject a bit, and can see that the Wikicode for adding categories is straight forward - my first step to adding relevant categories. Now I need to find good ways to generate them. Here I have got as far as to the idea of copying category-lines from similar-subject articles. But I am still in doubt about the best other ways, such as by means of some existing lists, search functions for this in Wikipedia, that might exist - or other methods? So if you have got tips, they would be much appreciated. Kind regards.  Old Dane\n",

      "Red Peacock - You are correct to think something is amiss. Xeno apparently only saw that portion of the interview in which Susan actively argues with the insane man holding the hitler picture (as if that alone wasn't unprofessional). Apparently he didn't catch her arguing fervently with the suburban dad (discussed at length in the article) on behalf of Obama.  And, perhaps most importantly, he clearly didn’t catch how Susan treated individuals who accused Bush of being Hitler just several years ago.[] Obviously I don’t intend for that video to go up in the article, but I include it to demonstrate that Xeno’s Hitler-related argument is, to be charitable, a laughing matter. By the way, RedPeacock. If you ever want something REALLY entertaining to do, I would suggest going to the Keith Olbermann article and looking at the now-infamous “criticism” section in the talk page. A few conservatives were able to play on the Olbermann-worshipers’ intense devotion to him by getting them to go to such great depths to prevent inclusion into the article that it is not possible to read it without wondering if it’s all just a big joke. Seriously – it’s really long but well worth the read. I think a book could be written about it, perhaps as part of a larger effort to study why people are so biased on Wikipedia and – more importantly – why they can’t just be open about it.\n",

This is my home town and I did a lot of research into it's history and everything so that I could make a good article on it. I have received a lot of comments from people in my town about the article and a lot of them have told me they learned things that they didn't know before. Recently a user named Bearcat has merged a lot of stub articles into the article about their region. I'm not sure what the policy is on this. Most of the articles were about very unnotible places (mclarens settlement being the best example). But I'm a little unclear on why he seems to insist on merging cobden aswell. The article was over 10,000 words long. I know that there doesn't need to be articles on everything on earth but, and I realize I may be the minority on this, it seems like towns  should have their own articles. I mean.... people may want information about them and it was hard for me to find it all. Now the information is all broken up and scattered across the whitewater region article. \n",

      "\"heading. My common usage understanding of the word is that it means statistical information about something, or the study thereof. My own 1990 dictionary says demographics: data resulting from the science of demography, and demography: the scientific study of human populations, especially with relation to their size, structure and distribution. So on that basis, the articles would be correctly titled 'demographics of...', and quote lots of statistics. It would appear to me that, according to my quite large dictionary, the article is wrong in its definition of these two terms. At the least, it should explain that there is a possible different understanding of the terms.\n",
      "My own interest was how broad the term demographics is, and whether when discussing a population it would include information about the land area, climate, how wet it is, all that sort of stuff which undoubtedly affects and influences the people living there, even though it might not be the sort of information collected by modern advertising executives. I suspect that a difference in understanding of the terms has crept in because such people are only interested in a subset of the total information.   \n",
      " I completely agree with you dictionary. However the key phrase is \"\"the scientific study of human populations\"\". Once human population is no longer an essential part of the study (as in climate, landmass etc. which will be the same regardless of population) it is no demography; I do agree that if climate has an effect on the population (e.g. in the arctic region people tend to protect themselves against cold) it is interesting from demography; but without such reference not.   \n",

      "As a longtime Web Site content developer, K-12 Textbook editor, English Professor, Bible teacher, Music teacher, professional writer, and a one-time \"\"Jesus Musician,\"\" I've recently started a project (SchoolOfTheRock.com) to help disciple the 18-15-year olds I minister to regularly on issues of contemporary Christian living, especially in areas related to worship and Bible teaching.  Despite an ad here or there on the site to help pay a fraction of the site's expenses, you'd be hard-pressed to call it a commercial endeavor. (I pay the site's manifold expenses as a \"\"write-off\"\" from my professional consulting business.)  \n",

      "To find links I could include from my pages, I went looking for any internet articles that provided insightful, balanced, detailed, and fact-based accounts of the history of Contemporary Christian music.  I didn't find any that fulfilled all of those qualificatiosn.  Your Wikipedia summary IS useful, and is a good introduction, VERY appropriate for Wikipedia, but I wanted something that presented more details and presented them in a stronger narrative that showed the history of Christian music from the musician's perspective.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So I wrote an fact-based, detailed, well-organized article that included, not only the history of the industry, but also personal experiences as well as the experiences of friends who were either touring artists or industry professionals. \n",

      "Or maybe you're put off by some of the \"\"negative\"\" statements about dark times in the history of Christian music.

I recognize that is is NOT a Wikipedia article, but it is a fact-based, detailed, and hopefully balanced article nonetheless, far more so than quite a few other article links I see on similar Wikipedia pages. It is not advertising any specific product, or even any commercial web site.  BTW CCM magazine is commercial - they cost money to subscribe to and have LOADS of advertising.  Why do you have THEIR link, if you are seeking to avoid even the appearance of supportiing a commercial enterprise.\n",

In other presentations of the LCC, the reader is left to wonder what the various categories mean - if he wants to know what a term presented in the LCC is about, he or she has to look the words up (and key them in) somewhere else.

      "Wikipedia is not a soapbox, a battleground, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. This applies to articles, categories, templates, talk page discussions, and user pages. Therefore, content hosted in Wikipedia is not:\n",
      "\n",
      "Propaganda, advocacy, or recruitment of any kind, commercial, political, religious, or otherwise. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view. You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.[1] \n",
      "\n",
      "Opinion pieces. Although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to \"\"climb soapboxes\"\" (i.e. passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced to put entries, especially for current events, in a reasonable perspective, and represent a neutral point of view. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete. However, Wikipedia's sister project Wikinews allows commentaries on its articles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Scandal mongering or gossip. Articles about living people are required to meet an especially high standard, as they may otherwise be libellous or infringe the subjects' right to privacy. Articles should not be written purely to attack the reputation of another person. \n",
      "\n",
      "Self-promotion. It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects in which you have a strong personal involvement. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself or about projects close to you. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest. \n",
      "Advertising. Articles about companies and products are written in an objective and unbiased style. Article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small \"\"garage\"\" or local companies are typically unacceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they identify major organizations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Wikipedia neither endorses organizations nor runs affiliate programs. See also Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies) for guidelines on corporate notability. Those promoting causes or events, or issuing public service announcements, even if noncommercial, should use a forum other than Wikipedia to do so. \n",

      " an incident has occurred within the church involving some type of sexual scandal. There is a discussion between the churches ip and members of Wikipedia if this  Between 1984 and 1989 John Langworthy was a youth minister at Prestonwood Baptist Church. On January 22nd, 2013, Langworthy pled guilty to five of eight felony counts of gratification of lust against young boys, receiving a suspended sentence of 50 years. He was also required to register as a sex offender. The offences occurred at Morrison Heights Baptist Church in Clinton, MS.[11] It was reported that Langworthy also admitted, in a pulpit confession, to prior sex offenses at Prestonwood Baptist Church. Some of the alleged victims made complaints to Prestonwood Church at the time, which were dealt with internally by church officials.[12] There are now allegations that Prestonwood Baptist Church covered up Langworthy's offenses by failing to report them to the proper authorities.

      "A series of publications has focused on the effects of exposure to low frequency (<500 Hz) high intensity (>90 dB) noise, a range of structural lung changes having been reported mainly in rats12 but also in humans.13 These data suggest that low frequency high intensity noise may lead to structural and functional changes in the airways, pleural mesothelium, and lung parenchyma. With frequencies from commercial loud speakers typically in the range of 30 Hz to 20 kHz, it is the lower frequency band of 30–150 Hz which is usually boosted in big music venues for enhanced effect. These low frequencies could indeed be particularly damaging to the lung parenchyma if they coincide with its natural frequency of around 128 Hz.14 Furthermore, Mahagnah and Gavriely15 showed that, in normal humans, the lung acts as a low pass filter with flat transmitted energy up to 100 Hz or 300 Hz. In view of these experimental results, the most compelling observation in our four patients is that the lower frequency band, which tends to be boosted in the kind of music they listen to, corresponds with those frequencies, thereby ensuring maximal acoustic energy transfer to the lungs.\n",

On site hydrogen reforming may be cheap, but the cost of delivering liquid hydrogen fuel is nearly the same as electrolysis.  Furthermore, no one has mentioned the costs of electrolysis using hydro-electric power, tidal, or wind.  In an ocean based plant using the sea water (a natural electrolyte which electrolyzes better than pure water) with tidal power, wind, and solar operating in tandem the costs would be VERY cheap.  And, the costs must be considered to be amortized over the lifetime of the plant.  Solar panels, windmills, and tidal generators have a one-time, fixed cost, and then they run basically for free until repairs become necessary.  \n",

Tipler; also available here\"\". Whereas the version before was properly cited: \"\"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: \"\"The Ends of the Universe,\"\" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.\"\"\n",

      "As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an \"\"eminent physicist\"\" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.\n",

Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an \"\"eminent physicist\"\" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.\n",

Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals).

Roy Eugene Davis was ordained by Paramahansa Yogananda himself in 1951. So, for someone like him to agree that this Hariakhan Baba is the same as the Mahavatar Babaji mentioned by his Master and venerated by all legitimate kriyabans from the Lahiri Lineage is not a light matter.\n",

Eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when I reinstated the article. Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out.

      "\n",
      "One of the best ways to get the Astrology Page back to good use was mentioned by Chris Brennan, who wisely thought that a Wiki-project on Astrology would help. I agree with Chris. Astrology is most likely the oldest, and best documented science in the history of humankind, leading to the invention of mathematics, medicine, and many other disciplines taken for granted by conventional science. Moreover, the history of astrology is also well-documented, even in the United States, where it must be remembered that it is an historical fact that the Founding Fathers of the U.S. not only practiced astrology, but used its principles to set, and then build Washington D.C., aligning the capital with the fixed stars in the constellation Virgo. The expert astrologers, and those with the knowledge base have worked hard, and seriously to improve the page; however, the arguments that seek to \"\"debase\"\" astrology from a POV has disrupted the Wiki-Astrology page based on the failure to not accept historical facts while promoting a \"\"pseudo-science\"\" viewpoint designed to blot out over 5,000 years of historical and scientific fact. A balance, with facts, surely can proceed, and Chris Brennan's idea of a project would help to combine diversifed views into cohesive subject matter that seeks to enlighten the mind, rather than to darken it. Welcoming views that seek to expand the knowledge base, rather than to shrink it through personal POV, is the best course. \"\n",

      "Hello Slrubinstein, I was a witness to the vast changes in the evolution article. Once it started it was like a wild fire. In fact, I saw it coming and tried (and failed-oddly phrased and hyperlinked on Dec 8)to improve the first paragraph. After Adam's changes, I realized the experts have had their say it seems appropriate to let the novices have ago. I wrote to Roland and Graft with this sentiment, but also my apprehensions-that it is too simplestic, may lead to misconceptions, not neccessarily improved where it is good, and this method of rapid and bulky changes will start a stampede (which it has). Roland is studying for exams, but dropped in enough to say he hated all the changes. I have been trying to be supportive of their effort, but hoping all the expert editors who gave me a hard time would resurface to defend the merits of the original article. I thought the first paragraph did need some attention, but I thought minor edits would ensue not vast rewrites. This could go on forever. Why can't an article be protected at certain stage so Talk could continue but changes would go before a committee to decide whether the change or addition is warranted (keep it current). I actually wrote a section for Evodev a few weeks ago, but never added it. I was concentrating on a couple of good examples, but now I realize a better way. There is some movement in embryology and developmental biology which is good. Fill does have some good editing for a Simple:evolution article. Isn't there a wikipedia for kids also? Although I wanted to change or add to the original, it was an excellent and informative article. It has been a week since the major overhaul so now maybe it is time to critique.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"\"Economist Steven Landsburg has claimed that paper recycling actually reduces tree populations. He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish the forests they own, large demands for paper lead to large forests. Conversely, reduced demand for paper leads to fewer \"\"farmed\"\" forests.[34] Similar arguments were expressed in a 1995 article for The Free Market.[35]\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If the variable of incentive to plant new trees is taken to be proportionate to the number of trees required for paper, as this scenario suggests, then the only way that the scenario is true is if it not only assumes that the paper companies are planting fewer trees than they cut, but that more trees are cut down than exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest refutation of the scenario is the model where lumber companies plant as many trees as they cut down. In this case, the number of trees not cut down, due to less paper being required, is immaterial, as the lumber companies would simply plant a number equal to what had been cut. In addition, more old trees would stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, let us pursue the other, and in my opinion more likely, scenario. Companies cut down more trees than they plant. For the sake of simplicity, consider this hypothetical starting state. Forestry companies cut down half existing trees, and replant half of the difference between what stood and and what has been felled, or 25%, for a total of 75% of the original number, if not the original quality, the new trees being young growth. Let us say recycled paper amounts to one half of the trees cut, 12.5%, which would bring the total in terms of usable resource to 87.5%. If it were not added, the next cycle would see the 75% cut, literally, in half, for 37.5%; half is replanted, for a total of 56.25%. If it were added, the 87.5% would be halved to 43.75%, and the company replanting half of that would make a total of 65.625%, almost 10% more trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does not matter whether the companies plant as many as were cut, if they are induced by the remaining forest amount, or a percentage, or induced by the paper supply, or a percentage; it always ends up with less forest cut down.

      " Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, \"\"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?

      "But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, \"\"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit...\"\").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.\n",

Arabs populating the land of Israel (sorry, \"\"Palestine\"\") then, even before they came up with the great idea of calling themselves Palestinians, weren't exactly innocent. I do not think I ever said how it began and who's fault it is. I have an opinion and you can guess it, but it's irrelevant. The question is how it can end. Since there are two peoples and one isn't going to kill the other, the only way is to reach some kind of agreement. This agreement cannot be reached while one is determined to destroy the other. Freeing Gaza is a noble goal and it was within reach in 2005. Destroying Israel is wrong and it just won't happen. Open-minded liberals (I believe it includes you) don't understand that by justifying and backing up the atrocities committed by radical terrorists they causing more suffering to their brainwashed but otherwise innocent subjects/hostages.

      "I see you reverted posts commenting on your deletion of a portion of ip 71.190.64.84's post which quoted and cited a positive entry you made to Flewis' talk page, and my notation that perhaps this was improper (deleting non abusive substance within an editor's note on your page); I see in your deletion history you wrote history does not mean bias; I note that my post (deleted by you) included another (quoted) post of further communication between you and Flewis that was also indicative of a further positive relation history; it is my view that deleting my post on this topic was not helpful, but posting your reply on the talk page would have been preferable.  Either way, my response is that positive relationships can create bias or the appearance of bias, which appears to be one of the many issues this talk section touches on.  My two cents.  Deletion of other's posts when they are not vandalism is not conducive to good editing or atmosphere, I suggest.  Especially when the deletions are done so quickly and the argument to which they refer remains up.  As to your attempts to prevent people from posting without signing from an account, and calling such ip posts suspect sockpuppets, I cannot disagree further and believe wiki policy backs me up in this.  Good day.  (I also note ip posts, like accounts, are anonymous, each in different ways, and some easier, some harder, for different users to adapt to.  It is the user's choice, not yours.  Please note I am not seeking a response and you should feel absolutely no obligation to do so on this latter point - there are blogs for that I'm sure!)96.232.226.87\n",

      "  Dear Ninhil, I thank you very much for intervening... at least this much is accepted by a neutral arbitrator that in case two authors differ in their versions, both versions must be allowed to be retained.  Since you wanted specific instances, in the book named Ancient India (1956) by K.A.N.Sastri, he has stated clearly while describing Rajendra Chola I that among the list of conquests (at one point he stated clearly thus:) 'next was the turn Satyasraya who was defeated and banished out of his capital'.  This can be contrasted with the statement in this Article that Satyasraya was able to control Chola aggression basing his contention on material from author Suryanath Kamath, without commenting on the accuracy of Suryanath Kamath's version, I accept your verdict that both versions should be allowed to be retained.  Dinesh is also erring badly when he writes subsequently in this article about Jayasimha also fighting hard with the Cholas (in fact Rajendra Chola ruled during the time of Satyasraya as well as Jayasimha and has claimed to defeat both) and also goes on to add that both sides lost and won but both K.A.N.Sastri and Rajendra's inscriptions at the Tanjore temple (courtesy the summary of Prof. Huntzsch, noted epigraphist appointed by the Archaelogical Survey of India, a body of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India, whose finds are given in detail at inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ - a site despised unnecessarily by Dinesh Kannambadi as a POV site because its findings go against 'historical events and their conclusions' of his liking) state that he emulated his father in winning the 'seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi' and where Prof. Huntzsch has clearly arrived at the conclusion (after reading Chola inscriptions from the times of Raja Raja Chola because it was from his time onwards that there were several wars between the Cholas and Chalukyas) that winning seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi meant winning the war and levying tribute on the losing Chalukya king.  Satyasraya lost twice, once to Raja Raja Chola when the Chola army was led by his son Rajendra and once to Rajendra, who also went on to defeat Satyasraya's successor Jayasimha II and Prof. Huntzsch once again attests the expression by Rajendra Chola I in the inscription at the Tanjore temple, a World Heritage site ': \"\"the seven and a half lakshas of Iratta-padi, (which was) strong by nature, (through the conquest of which) immeasurable fame arose,[7] (and which he took from) Jayasimha, who, out of fear (and) full of vengeance, turned his back at Muyangi and hid himself\"\", as the Chola once again winning the war (this time it was over Vengi with the Chola army first routing the Chalukyas near Rajahmundry and subsequently at Masangi (called Muyangi in the Chola inscriptions in Tamil langauge), causing their king Jayasimha to banish and then levying tribute on the defeated Chalukya.' These have been attested by both K.A.N.Sastri and R.C.Roychowdhuri in their two books of the same name i.e. Ancient India.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To repeat the above, the author R.C.Roychowdhuri in his book Ancient India borrows heavily by quoting extensively from K.A.N.Sastri - this unfortunately, goes against the thinking of user Kannambadi who is repeating blindly that I have no sources - I can assure you certainly I can read and write. It is very poor in taste, the expression of Dinesh Kannambadi who has gone on to justify my previous blocking, as is evident on my talk page dear Ninhil, this was done by user Blinguen an admin probably, who barged into my talk page and blocked me without giving any reason the second time i.e. he violated two rules of Wikipedia which are being advocated by Dinesh Kannambadi and another clique at work in wikipedia, first they ask people like us, who draw from sources and post at times historical events which are not palatable to them,  that we should first post on the discussion page, but in my case I was straight away blocked on the first occasion by user Blinguen who certainly did not discuss with me on the article discussion page nor did he discuss the topic itself with me.  The second time Blinguen entered my talk page, left a comment that he did not like what I wrote for he thought what I wrote was a personal commentary (when in actuality, it was a summary of Chola historty from which I drew from Prof. Huntzsch's summary from inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ but had made the mistake (I am not shy of admitting I make mistakes) of not posting the source, but before I realized and re-entered the Chola page, I found first that I was not able to edit and found to my horror that Blinguen has arrived at a certain conclusion and blocked me without giving me a chance to explain, discuss or argue with me on the concerned topic and its contents, just as Dinesh Kannambadi is trying to do now by painting anyone whose findings he doesn't like, in black.\n",

Let me try to summarize your post to see if I indeed understood it: The supreme derivates his power from writing/dictating, unfortunately for him, language can just as easily be used by others to oppose him, this is exemplified by the pasquinade (hence its importance) in which his writing and indeed his self (character perhaps?) and ultimately his own authority is usurped by the anonymous writer by making use of Francias own game (ie: writing/language). So far so good? And what about the compiler and Roa Bastos? Can the pasquinade be understood as a metaphor for what they are, themselves, doing to Francias writings (usurping it, questioning the nature of his absolute power and relativizing  it) ?   Or is their relationship more complicated?

If there's a hostile editing environment, I'm not the one to blame. And as in (1) above, it was not a threat anyway  I was offering a favour in exchange for CurtisNaito granting me the favour of not requesting that I be site-banned anymore. If this is what you meant, it's a good faith misunderstanding, and I will try to avoid such misunderstandings in the future, but I should still be unblocked.\n",

      "The real problem is that User:Musical_Linguist has a personal grudge against me and vigorously hunts for and reverts all of my attempts at dialog with the rest of the Wikipeida community.  Clearly, Wikipedia, with 1,000,000 articles is now big enough for the two of us, but she a pretty and polite female and so she has the upper hand.  She seems to have nothing to offer the Bill of attainder aritcle except to hit the undo button if she thinks that I have effected any changes.  Surely, she has a personal motivation directed towards me personally.  That is not really how adminship is supposed to work, is it: that an admin can hold a grudge and personally hunt down an individual other person?  Is there not some mechanism by which she can be instructed to direct her attention away from my activities and let the other 800 Wikipedia admins perform the job of protecting Wikipeida from Andrew William Morrow?  If the problem is truly Andrew William Morrow, then it will be obvious to the other admins, but in fact, that has not been the case.  Oh sure, there has been the occasional problem (if you look at my Wikipedia work as indexed on my web site, you will see that I choose to focus on controversial biographies with a high content of U.S. case law).  This Irish woman has nothing to offer the articles she has personally targeted via this tool Template:Pinktulip except to hit the undo button. She has done no research.  She has conducted no dialog with other editors.  Like you, she always claims to be \"\"too busy\"\" to engage in any actual dialog, but she has plenty of time to sit around and chat with her Catholic pro-life friends and hit the undo button every time she sees non-vandalism contributions that she simply does not like.  As you can see by her user page, she is highly prone to view the work of others through the rather narrow prism of her Pope's worldview.  If you study Special:Contributions/Musical Linguist you will see that she spends many, many hours on Wikiepdia every day and note the quick response time of her reverts: She must be monitoring her watch list vigorously.  Is this really what you want Wikipedia to be about?  Letting admins, no matter how polite, intelligent and pretty impose their worldview on others?  Is it such a tragedy to put some horse-blinders on her to say: \"\"For these specific users and these specific articles, you will stay away.  You have had much more than your fair turn at these specific users and these specific articles and now you, dear and valued admin, are being administratively rotated out of them and you will stay rotated out of them for a good, long time.\"\"  Is that such a tragedy?  Fred: It is only a tragedy if the problem is really within the admin herself, rather than within the targeted or banned user(s).  The mature admin would not take such instructions as an insult, but simply as a matter of due course.  Musical Linguist is much like the childless woman hovering over someone else's child, ever-ready to snatch the child and claim it for her own.  It is a natural impulse, but it requies intervention because it is also a disorderly impulse.  All I have done is to flush the woman out by getting her to fill out the \"\"Pinktulip\"\" template completely.  Her contribution to the information content the articles listed in the Pinktulip template is zero, but but she now exerts total control of them.  She is merely a sterile, charming, controlling woman and she should herself now be controlled.  She is all process and no results.  That is not what Wikipeida was supposed to be about.\n",

I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?\n",

I think that the Razin that's a painter is probably a far more recent person since a search for \"\"S Razin\"\" (the name that comes up in the eBay auctions) shows that he's from the 21st century, not from the 1600s.

That's pretty clearly related to his significance as a creationist, and not some interest in writing about about chess more generally.  An implication of a \"\"pretext to promote a creationist agenda\"\" does not appear to correlate with what I said at all.

As you both represent the German chapter of wikipedia, you officially, Mr. Marcus Cyron as a former administrator, as a writer in residence and much more, it's normal that people try to get in contact with you or with him, especially if they are involved in bizarre communication processes that convert de.wiki into a arbitrary \"\"regime\"\". As my Real-Life-Identity behind Filliou has been revealed by third parties accessing absolutely private database information within the de.wiki, I'm using my account Filliou only within the en.wiki as a sign of protest against the unpleasant manners, the bad practices, the mobbing and hounding that takes place within the de.wiki.

      "I can understand your reasons for taking a break. As I have been indicating, the atmosphere is severe. It can have a severe effect on folks unused to such atmosphere. I had noticed that you were saying something about infoboxes at the ANI. As far as I know, there is no set vetting process required for putting up any infoboxes. So, anyone can put up any infobox they want. I don't see much of a value in such infoboxes. I like to form my own opinion based on the particular user's edits and comments only. Looking at the edits and comments of some of the folks who do have infoboxes...... Actually, to my way of thinking, there is no need for such infoboxes. Things become easily obvious from edits and comments alone. I do not say anything about your edits and comments because I think I am unqualified to make an assessment for your contributions. I think I have known some fine scholars on WP and have participated in some exhilarating discussions with them. But invariable, I find their userpages without any infoboxes saying it. Why does one need state the obvious? Actually, I think there are some disadvantages to putting up such infoboxes. If you are seriously considering putting up one, I think you may want to know my detailed view on it in beforehand. Looking at some of your comments, I have the most unmistakable impression that you have an excellent grasp of such issues. I have known very few users about whom I could say the same. (I am speaking only about the ones which I have seen). As such, I was looking forward to other people's sense of sourcing issues would also improve (by having discussions with you). I have also been looking for a particular quote from one particular source and I had the impression that you might probably be in a position to help me in that regard. It is about some other, unrelated article. But since you are busy now, I don't think it would be proper for me to bother you with some silly request of mine.  I have noticed that the catalyst with sidekicks is happy because they have been able to drive you away.  Actually, it seems to me that they have driven away hundreds of users and also caused blocks on scores of others, are experts at harassing others with warnings, long winded arguments, irrelevant comments, severe ad hominem attacks, etc. etc. etc. also know how to obtain blocks for their opponents at ANIs.....

      " \"\"At the close of the twentieth century, \"\"Canadian\"\" has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group, up from 0.5 percent in 1986 to nearly 4 percent in 1991 and to 31 percent in the 1996 census of Canada. From what groups did this \"\"indigenous\"\" label draw in the five years between the 1986-1991 and the 1991-1996 censuses? Using unpublished tabulations from the 1986, 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses, this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the Canadian-born age 25-44 in 1986 (and age 34-54 by 1996). We find that most of the increases between 1986 and 1991 in \"\"Canadian\"\" ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in British origin responses. Between 1991 and 1996, increasing Canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the British and French ethnic origin counts. In some provinces, notably the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups.\"\"   \n",

The Cathedral of Learning seems to be a pretty big landmark, and certainly can be included; including CMU as well would seem to represent Pittsburgh's status as an educational city. Maybe put those two as the images at the bottom? For the other two images, maybe either Heinz Field or PNC Park (but not both, as too many sports pictures would be overkill; but we could put, for example, PNC Park in the infobox and then a picture of Heinz Field in the Sports section).

      "On inspection, the references to '1996' in the 'Jim Bell' article are not footnoted.  (And, they never have been, since Skomorokh added them 2 years ago).  The AP essay was begun about April 1995, and eventually grew to include 10 parts.  The first 7 parts were written in 1995, and were published immediately as they were written.  Part 8 was a copy of an article by a journalist, Paul Maxwell, writing in the Asahi Evening News (English language newspaper in Japan).   It and parts 9 and 10 were written about February 1996.  You can be sure that by July 1995, 'the Feds' were well aware of the content of the (then-growing) AP essay. The Feds subsequently concealed their early knowledge of the AP article:  One technique they used, when the applied for a warrant, was for the affiant to claim something like, 'I first became aware of the AP essay on....'   That specific affiant ['affidavit writer' for you who don't know the law] may very well have 'first become aware' on some late date, but that doesn't mean that other Feds weren't aware, months or well over a year before.  It served the purposes of the Feds to make it appear not merely that the AP essay was written far closer to Bell's May 1997 arrest, but also to conceal the fact of their agent Walsh/Wilson's involvement perhaps one year prior to Bell's first attendance of MCCLC meetings.  Why?   It sounds much more like an 'emergency' if something happened yesterday, or last week:  They certainly wouldn't have wanted to have to tell the judge, 'Well, Bell wrote this TERRIBLE essay...two years ago' !!!\n",
      "This explains, I believe, why Skomorokh claimed the AP essay was written in '1996', and furthermore gave no references. '1996' (at least, December 1996) sounds reasonably close to early 1997.  'April 1995', on the other hand, sounds like an eternity from May 1997, the month Bell was arrested.  71.36.117.224\n",

Furthermore, by his own discussion in the Caparzo death scene (\"\"that's where I'd be if I were him\"\",) Jackson does have some training in sniper tactics and fieldcraft. There is no evidence whatsoever that he is any sort of sharpshooter, and until such sourceable evidence is provided, it must remain as sniper, which is the by far more accurate result, in terms of both google search, and reality.

Whether claimed as required or not by whichever registries or breeders, these claims have no value (other than through \"\"blind trust\"\") to potential puppy buyers unless they have an opportunity to verify the results themselves through independent means.\n",

'People have died after taking mephedrone' is intended to summarise \"\"mephedrone had been alleged to be involved in 52 fatalities in the UK, but detected in only 38 of these cases\"\". Likewise 'some deaths the media attributed to the drug were later determined to have been caused by other factors' is summarising \"\"The death of a teenager in the UK in November 2009 was widely reported as being caused by mephedrone, but a report by the coroner concluded she had died from natural causes. In March 2010, the deaths of two teenagers in Scunthorpe were widely reported by the media to be caused by mephedrone. Toxicology reports showed the teenagers had not taken any mephedrone and had died as a result of consuming alcohol and the heroin substitute methadone\"\". Both parts are important and should be mentioned in the lead and if you read the references you should realise that this is exceptional to mephedrone as deaths were over-reported and mis-reported by the media - comparisons with other topics are irrelevant. I agree that it is a bit weasely, but how else to you suggest that that section is summarised? WP:LEADCITE is very vague about whether citations are required and when I wrote the lead I erred on making it easier to read rather than ensuring that every fact was supported by a citation there (Wikipedia:Citation_overkill). I could easily copy the references from the main article to the lead for this sentence, but then someone will likely come along and complain that other sentences don't have citations...

It was beginning to appear that your colleagues were teaming up in a Revert War. In fact, they did just that in another article we posted about area poet William Heyen  they kept Copyvio-ing it, though in fact it was written by us for our own journal, Exit Online. When I pointed this out, I was told, in effect, \"\"Oh yeah? Well, prove it!\"\"\"\" I have no idea what sort of \"\"proof\"\" one can offer for owning someone one has posted to their own web site (or any other web site for that matter). More to the point, THEY offered no suggestions as to how one might \"\"prove it.\"\" If you have an email address for someone at WikiP who oversees this sort of stuff, then let me know and we'll be happy to contact him/her.\n",
      "4. As for \"\"my article,\"\" I was referring to the fact that it's mine by virtue of the fact that I authored it. In fact, your own guidelines specifically state that the author of each edit is the author and has only granted a GFDL license, so that author can be said to be the owner of that particular edit. That could even be the whole article. For this reason, the authors don't have to comply with the GFDL requirements for their own writing - the GFDL license doesn't override their own rights to use their own work. They can also license it to any number of others under any other licenses they choose, since that's one of the rights authors have.\n",
      "5. Thanks for your candor over concerns about EB suits over copyright. Maybe EB has folks that spend their days doing nothing but monitor WikiP, though I somehow doubt it since they would not have access to the same \"\"new posting\"\" info that you and your colleagues use to monitor postings. It would take an army of staff even to randomly check WikiP listings.\n",
      "6. As for creating an account, in fact, my colleagues and I do have accounts and would, indeed, like the \"\"credit\"\" for our efforts.

In 1939 - at the beginning of World War II - the family returned to Turkey. He graduated high school in Turkey in the year 1953. This high school's name was \"\"Ankara Maarif College\"\" since 1951.[7] The courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in this school had been given by English teachers in the English language since 1949.[8][9] Sinanoglu learned the English language very well in this high school.\n",

      "In his autobiographical book entitled \"\"Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book,\"\" which was published in Turkey in the Turkish language (first printing in October 2001 and 70. printing in April 2011, a bestseller: 150,000 copies), he stated that, in the summer holiday 1952-1953, he applied to the JAMMAT \"\"Joint American Military Mission for Aid to Turkey\"\" (renamed JUSMMAT in 1958)[10][11][12] to get a job as a translator. His application was accepted by the U.S. Army Staff in Ankara, and he was sent on duty to Erzurum as translator for Secret G2 Military Intelligence Agents Sergeant Kowalski and Sergeant Peterson.[13] After graduating high school in 1953, a scholarship was given to him by the Fulbright Program to study chemistry in the United States.[14] According to the agreement, students were elected by the U.S. Education Commission in Turkey, but funding of the scholarship was provided by the government of Turkey, because Turkish students will return after graduation in the U.S.A to become teachers in Turkey. Sinanoglu was sent with this expectation to the U.S.A.\n",

Afterwards, in eight months, he earned a Master's degree with highest honors from MIT (1957); and after this, in two years, he finished his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley (1959).[16] Subsequently, he finished a one-year postdoctoral research appointment at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California Berkeley (1959-1960).[17] So, his pupilage ended in 1960.\n",

      "Violating Scholarship Agreement and Military Service Obligation to Live in the U.S.A.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the 1953 scholarship agreement, after graduation, Sinanoglu was obligated to return to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students.[18] Sinanoglu stated in his autobiographical book that: \"\"Returning to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students in the English language was worse than death, a horrible and dishonorable thing. İnstead of this, to stay in the U.S.A. and to teach chemistry to American students in the English language was a more honorable thing. I swore that: I will not return to Turkey; I will stay in the U.S.A and I will be a chemistry teacher in American universities.”[19] So Sinanoglu violated the 1953 scholarship agreement and did not return to Turkey. But there was a second problem: According to the military service obligation laws of his country, after finishing his studies in 1960, Sinanoglu was to return to Turkey to fulfill an 18-month military service obligation. The penalty for violating the scholarship agreement was a fine: the payment of a sum of money. But the penalty for violating one's military service obligation was the cancellation of one's passport and visa; this penalty could not be paid by money in those years (1960s). He stated in his autobiographical book: \"\"Theoretical Physicist Feza Gursey wrote a letter to me inviting me to the Middle East Technical University which was being established in Ankara, Turkey. But I couldn't return to Turkey because of the military service obligation. If I went to Turkey, I would be a soldier for 2-2,5 years.\"\"[20] An easy way to stay in the U.S.A. was to marry and father a child in that country.\n",

      "By:  Mark A. Varca, Chief Information Officer, FedCURE.\n",
      "\n",
      "FedCURE is the world's leading advocate for America's, ever growing, federal inmate population. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to extend an invitation to each of you to join us in our efforts to reform the federal criminal justice system in the United States. Federal CURE, Incorporated, is a nonprofit organization that, inter alia, deals largely with the issues faced by federal inmates and their loved ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are working to reinstate parole; increase good time allowances;  provide for compassionate releases; restore PELL grants; and opportunities for successful reentry  into the community, for all federal offenders; and promote a system that incarcerates fewer people and provides humane conditions for those who are incarcerated or under post-incarceration supervision via parole or supervised release. Over 45,000 people were released from federal prison in the United States last year.  On this day, the United States Federal Bureau of Prisons houses 185,100+ people.  Most serving long, non parolable, sentences for non violent offenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please consider, if you have not already, joining and contributing to FedCURE.  We are the world's leading experts in matters relating to federal inmates.  Collectively, five of FedCURE's 14 board members have over 50 years of in prison experiencebehind the fenceas former federal inmates.   Each holding J.D.'s, two holding LL.M's and two holding Ph. D's.  Our lifetime members include the best criminal attorneys in the United States.  .\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Martha Stewart's incarceration has made her the DIVA of federal criminal justice reform in the United States.\"\"  Mrs. Stewart wrote from prison in a December 2004 letter posted on her Web site, \"\"I beseech you all to think about these [inmates] - to encourage the American people to ask for reforms, both in sentencing guidelines, in length of incarceration for nonviolent first-time offenders, and for those involved in drug-taking.\"\"  The synergies behind that have yet to unfold.  However, we can state with confidence that, when all the discussions settle on the table concluding that the federal criminal justice system in the United States is undoubtedly broken and in need of reform; and that after all of the discussion about what's wrong with the system and what can be done to fix it comes to rest, in the end, it always comes down to one important reform issue:  To reduce federal prison sentences.  In today's political environment, however, there is only one possible hope that would best accomplish this reform:  Enact federal legislation to revive our former system of parole for federal prisoners; and to provide new re-entry opportunities for people being released from prison. \n",
      "\n",
      "To that end, FedCURE is feverishly advocating in favor of  H.R. 3072 (former H.R. 4036, as amended) a bill to Revive the System of Parole for Federal Prisoners, that was introduced, in the 109th Congress, by the Honorable U.S. Representative, Danny K. Davis (D) of Illinois on 27 June 2005.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Parole of federal offenders began after enactment of legislation on June 25, 1910.  Under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the United States Parole Commission retained jurisdiction over defendants who committed their offenses prior to November 1, 1987.  At the same time, the Act provided for the abolition of the Parole Commission on November 1, 1992.  The phase out of the Commission has been extended by statute several times. The status of the Commission beyond November 1, 2005 remains unresolved despite the Commission having taken over supervision of all DC offenders in addition to the remaining 4,000 Old Law offenders.  Presently, the Commission has over 100 employees and a budget of over $10 million.   H.R. 3020, introduced on 22 June 2005, seeks \"\"To extend the existence of the U.S. Parole Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the U. S. Sentencing Guidelines were imposed for federal defendants whose criminal activities took place subsequent to November 1, 1987, parole was eliminated.  Early release was limited to approximately 47 days of good time each year and the sentences themselves were increased appreciably.  The majority of federal inmates are non-violent low-level drug offenders with very long sentences.  Moreover, the majority of this segment of the federal inmate population is being incarcerated for the first time. Thousands of people in prison are serving life sentences for non-violent offenses without the possibility of parole.  The vast majority of these people are also first time offenders.  \n",

      "Your closure of that ANI report is unwise at best, abusive at worst. Ample evidence of wrong doing has been provided, maybe not with respect to the BI sanction (but even that is not clear cut, given it is meant to be broadly construed), but definitely in the sense that these edits are clearly the same terminology policing behaviour that led to that sanction, but on a slightly different BI related term. Action is clearly warranted. Archived or not, as I said, I am not going to let this lie, I will be informing Cailil when he returns. In addition to sanctioning Highking, I expect he will want to take issue with you disrespecting him by completely ignoring all the effort he went to in detailing exactly what is wrong with HighKing's behaviour, and what he should be avoiding. Who I am is completely and utterly irrelevant to whether or not HighKing is ignoring those warnings and engaging in the beahviour Cailil described as being not wanted here. He even made that exact point to HighKing - while Cailil has sympathy with the so called harassment he often claims to be suffering as a way of avoiding sanctions for making these edits, Cailil was crystal clear on the point that who reports him, or even just the mere presence of suspect accounts in any of these reports/disputes, has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he will act on any poor behaviour he observes from HighKing. I know he has previously expressed frustration at seemingly being the only admin here who is prepared to deal with HighKing, and I can see why with actions like this. Your closure of the section simply because of who the complainents are has only one effect - rewarding HighKing for bad edits. It's really no skin off my nose, is it? If I am a banned user, do you think archiving that discussion will have any effect on me? Or if I am not banned but this is just not my main account, then do you think archiving the section is going to change whatever reason I might have for not posting there with my main account? Of course not. The only thing it achieves is to remove from sight as an immediate issue. Which, given the fact Cailil was at pains to point out that HighKing's poor behaviour stretches back to 2008, is not a good thing for Wikipedia. You're an admin. You're expected to deal with long term problems, not sweep them under the carpet for wholly irrelevant reasons. If HighKing were ever to end up at arbitration for example, do you think he would escape sanction for persistent WP:TE behaviour, simply because other people involved were not following some completely unrelated rule like WP:SOCK? Of course not. Hopefully you can at least appreciate that as an admin, you being the person who maintains that cycle of WP:TE, is not only bad for Wikipedia, it's a form of laxity that really isn't excused by who I may or may not be. It also had the material effect of me not being able to correct Murray on a basic point of fact, meaning the archive now has errors in it, which I am sure is not the intent of that facility. Archive or no archive, at the very least, if, or more likely when, Cailil sanctions HighKing for those edits, I expect you to hold your hands up and admit your failure to do your duty as an admin in this case. Anything less will simply fall well below the expected standards of admins on Wikipedia. Anyway, I've probably spent far too long typing a post that you will most likely just ignore and delete, so goodbye for now.\n",

      "1 - No other character in any other Metal Gear title pages is given this amount of scrutiny. Quiet has been highlighted by the media as sexist, this is true. However this is not a reason for an encyclopedic entry to focus on a given character. The page is not a study of the media's (or anyone else's) reaction to Quiet as a character. There should be balance in the reception section, giving a whole section to Quiet versus no other characters is not balanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 - Misinformation. \"\"Michael McWhertor criticized Quiet's portrayal, pointing out that while the game explains that her nakedness derives from a photosynthetic skin condition, several other characters with the same condition — such as Code Talker in The Phantom Pain and The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater — appear fully clothed.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the source of information, if it is incorrect information it should not be in the entry. Quiet is naked because her lungs were burnt to a crisp, the game specifically mentions this and other fans have mentioned it on the page I believe. Code Talker and The End have the same ability correct, but they did not get set on fire and thrown out of a building. I'm really baffled this is in here because McWhertor is not an authority on this whatsoever. Kojima and the game writers are. Source it correctly or remove the information I would have said.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - Opinion columns. This baffles me. Why are opinion pieces been taken as reception? They are not professional video game reviewers. By the media's own admission they are just someone writing their opinion about something, it's not objective. They wouldn't even claim to be unbiased as it's an opinion. You are introducing bias here by taking an opinion and presenting it for no reason other than to say \"\"this person didn't like Quiet's portrayal\"\". If tomorrow Donald Trump wrote an opinion piece on Quiet for a media outlet, is that relevant to an encyclopedic entry about something?\n",

      "4 - Further irrelevant information. There are sources and information here that talk about the PlayArtsKai figurine of Quiet. Are you out of your mind?! What relevance does this have to the RECEPTION OF THE GAME??? The video game this entry is about. To start with PlayArtsKai is a completely separate company that we have no idea or information about how much Hideo Kojima was involved with. One would assume since they are completely different companies ENTIRELY that Konami simply licensed the intellectual property rights of Quiet to PlayArtsKai.

      "Jesus Bloodline is to be linked to \"\"esoteric Christianity\"\" it needs to be emphasised that it is to an untraditional and modern version of \"\"esoteric Christianity\"\" that has been influenced by Margaret Starbird. And this can be easily done. There are ample internet sites that define traditionalist esoteric Christianity and this needs to be compared against the esoteric Christianity that was inspired by Margaret Starbird. Traditional esoteric Christianity that dates historically back thousands of years to Origen of Alexandria dealt with metaphysical matters. The common interpretation of Gnosticism widely held by maistream scholarship is that it was a dualist nature holding that matter was evil and rejecting the physical substance of Christ. This can be easily substantuated by reliable and independent sources from works published by mainstream scholars. It was the book Holy Blood and Holy Grail that was first responsible for twisting the idea that Gnosticism \"\"believed that Jesus Christ was a human being\"\", and this became uncritically repeated ever since by those who uncritically follow the modern concept of the Jesus Bloodline. Again, it can be very easily verified by citing scholarly books that the Jesus Christ of Gnosticism was not a physical human being.

The counterpoint I made above is that using your argument, I can make an equally valid one for a different cast order, based on the order in which they appear on the official Grey's Anatomy page.  Personally, I think the most accurate way of listing them is as billed, in the opening credits.  Yes, they do say \"\"with-and\"\".  They could say \"\"featuring-and\"\" or simply \"\"and\"\".  Ultimately, IW and PD are billed last in the credits, so they should be listed last here if the general consensus is to use billing order for listing the cast.  That's the great thing about these discussion pagesit allows for differences of opinion to be expressed and consensus reached.  Currently, there are three opinions on record; two of them support listing the cast, as billed in opening credits, regardless of the \"\"with-and\"\" structure.  Hopefully others will chime in with their thoughts or opinions.  I apologize if you felt I was undermining your argument.  \"\n",

      "Actually, Nin Einne is right. I'll try to explain why. First thing: all scientific information (i.e. somewhat accurate info...) should be publically verifyable, where verifyable means that one can check whatever is claimed, and public refers to the fact that anyone can do that. Now, if you cite some source, like in the example above, it says \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"(citation number). Unlike what you might think, that does not mean that the sentence \"\"blah blah near daily\"\" is a universally accepted fact  as proven by the fact that you have another opinion. What the phrase \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"(citation number) actually means is \"\"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah near daily\"\", which, you'll agree, is fully correct. After all, that is what's written there and anyone can look at the source (because it's public) and read what is says (verifyable). Now, if you think that blah blah occured daily an not near daily, that is fine. But how should you go about it ? One thing you can not do: change the sentence and leave the citation! Because then it would mean: \"\"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah daily\"\". That is not true! If you look at the source, you'll see it says \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"! Which is just what Nil Einne pointed out. Of course it can happen that what's written in the source is not accurate. But that doesn't mean you have the right to change it as you did.\n",
      "What you can do is add another source that contradicts the first one. You could write It has been reported that \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"(citation number), but I think that \"\"blah blah daily\"\". The moment you do this, however, you'll find that people will object, because what you have presented is not publically verifyable. So, what is needed here is a source, a pointer to publically verifyable information, to support your claim. The full list of newspapers would be ok, but very unpractical. If there is a single list somewhere, preferably produced by a fairly neutral source such as United Nation observers of something equivalent, that would be much easier.\n",
      "You might think it's much more important to tell the truth accurately, even if you don't find a source, because, after all, the truth is what it's all about. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as the truth, a universally and unanimously accepted version of events, and certainly not in the Israelian-Palestian conflict. Imagine for a moment that everybody would put their version of the truth on the page, and what the page would then look like! So, we are bound by certain rules that allow us to govern information about events without spiraling into chaos, and these very rules that exist to create accurate information state that sticking to the rules is more important that providing accurate information. Strange as it may seem, it works: even when not perfectly accurate, the result will not stray to far from the truth, if there is any one such thing, and that result is usually a fairly useful document as opposed to a flamewar.\"\n",

At the time I thought it was a temporary measure and that the ultimate aim was to improve the suburban service (longer platforms, higher frequency, stops at both South Ruislip and West Ruislip, trains with faster acceleration – in short, something approaching an Overground-style service), but, as of May 2014, that hasn't happened and despite all the excitement about the Mainline service to Birmingham, the service has worsened significantly for the short-distance user. 92.40.248.181\n",

It is impossible to say \"\"no one are dinosaurs\"\". It has to be \"\"no one is a dinosaur\"\". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding \"\"none\"\" to \"\"no one\"\" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that \"\"none\"\" is a synonym for \"\"nothing\"\".

At the same time, however, one, the other, or something else IS factually true.  And so what SCIENCE needs to do is keep as BROAD a paradigm as possible in allowing itself to go through the process of falsification.  A scientific community that ASSUMES Genesis is true will be limited in its ability to falsify itself ... because it will always say, \"\"well ... we just haven't figuredn out how to justify that assumption yet  but we will!\"\"  Similarly, a scientific community that ASSUMES God does not exist will say the same thing.

It doesn't say that Australians haven't had great influence on rugby league. The descriptions of the sections don't need to be, and in fact shouldn't be in the same format, since the different groups are not exactly the same sort of groups. The different codes are grouped into sections based on their history and similarities between the codes. There are two very obvious big groups, both easily characterised by their \"\"ancestry\"\" - the kicking games descended from association rules and the carrying games descended from the rugby rules. The rest of the codes, all relatively minor in global terms, cannot be characterised by a single ancestry, and so shouldn't be. They are a group of games, some influenced by both soccer-type games and rugby school rules, with various influences within the group as well, that are most easily characterised by the fact that they are all Australian or Irish in origin.

      "Hey Sajoch, if you can discuss things relaxed for a bit, I do have a question I'd like to ask a Ladin from Bolzano.  I always hear about the Italians coming and taking over.  But, can you explain to me who exactly are \"\"the Italians\"\"?  As far as I know, Italian in the modern sense is simply a citizen of the Italian Republic.  Going back a few hundred years ago, I suppose people might say they are a people \"\"of Italy\"\", or the Italic peninsula.  But, I'd say that even to this day, many people in Italy don't refer to themselves as Italian first.  Aren't the people of Sicily, Sicilians?  The people of Napoli, Napolitani?  As far as I can tell, the \"\"Ladin\"\" are the people of the region we happen to call Trentino-Alto Adige, and also the Romansch speakers in Switzerland are speaking essentially the same (or a VERY similar) language.  It would make sense that this pocket of Europe has its own particular language, and a language which is old-Latin based.  So, when you say you are Ladin, and not Italian... to me that is no different from someone saying they are Sicilian, and not Italian.  Then that brings me back to my original question: who is actually Italian?  Isn't the Italian language the Tuscan language actually?  So are Italians actually the people from Tuscany?  I know that Trentino is said to be majority Italian, but the people there speak Italian in modern times because it is the national language.  They still speak their original dialects like Nones, Solardo, etc.. which are actually Ladin languages.  You know that, right?  So are the people in Trentino Ladin people, or have they transformed into Italians because the Italian Republic has a National Language?  I'm just throwing these questions out there, as someone interested in my own history.  I mentioned this once to noclador, \"\"who are the Italians?\"\" and all the discussion got me was him giving me the link to the Wikipedia page on Italians.  My guess is that some of the questions I was asking blurred the lines of a politics he would rather dream is black and white.  I'd like to see if you'd actually be interested to discuss this, as you are a fellow Ladin at least...\"\n",

You see, statements such as \"\"common citizens can gain access to these funds\"\" assumes  1) Purveyors of the Redemption Movement have all agreed somehow that these funds exist (who said that besides the SPLC? Anyone?) and that a safe assumption would be 'all purveyors of the redemption movement are at some time preoccupied with extracting these funds.     2) Purveyors of the Redemption Movement all agree in the existence of a 'common citizen', (what is a common citizen according to the Redemption Movement? Uuuuh.. Ummmm... Uuuuu...) 3) Purveyors of the Redemption Movement agree that only a 'common citizen' can gain access to these funds ...........   These are all assumptions that have been molded into the supposed history of the supposed Redemptionist, if you will. Nonsense!

      "GoodDay, the countries category is called just that, not 'Independant countries'. Wales, Scotland and England are countries (NI is not, but that's another matter). As they are countries they belong in the countries category, perfectly logically. In any case, this has been discussed repeatedly and the consensus is - as if we needed to be told! - that they are countries. Despite my opposition to the inclusion of the Six Counties - English Wikipedia has followed the political line of the New Labour UK government, a lie line which is contrary to the Belfast Agreement - I am tempted to agree with the compromise 'Category:Countries of the United Kingdom' but would like to hear other people's opinion as well. It's disappointing and somewhat surprising that such a significant change has attracted so little comment. Perhaps what we really need here in the long term is a clearer practical distinction between the terms 'country' and 'sovereign state'. BritishWatcher says above that he \"\"supported and accepted the fact England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should be called countries\"\" but opposes them \"\"appearing on lists of countries (where only sovereign states are listed)\"\". Therein lies the nub of the problem - the argument that although E, S and W are in fact countries they should not be listed as countries: talk about Alice in Wonderland!   \"\n",

Mutual masturbation is actually handjob and fingering, which of course is non-penetrative sex, not masturbation! Mutual masturbation is not about two people sitting opposite to each other and masturbating without touching one another, this is nonsense! If no contact exists, this is simple masturbation, no matter how close two persons are to each other. No contact = Masturbation.

The GNN was (possibly still is) a monitoring point for the US government. If you are not aware of what DARPA means i suggest you look it up. The government was, and does, keep a running list of ISPs that visit GNN via the Information Awarness Office (now called the Terrorism Information Awarness Program); The NSA wiretaping and so forth was part of that program. the lists of watched individuals is divided between DoD and NSA (more specifically department of intelligence) sources so that no one group can claim jurisdictionwhen DoD wants a list they say it is part of national intell, when intell comes they say it is DoD eyes only. Basically, there is a well maintained database of who visits and if you do anything else bad, well they have  a compelling case against you in the DARPA/DHS files.
